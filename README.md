# 📖 diAry — Digital Arianna

A project developed by the [University of Urbino](https://www.uniurb.it) and [DIGIT srl](http://digit.srl).

## The project

Digital Arianna”, or **diAry**, is a mobile application that allows you to **keep trace** of your past movements. These are stored exclusively on your device only and may be useful as a simple private “memory aid”, a system for tracking event participation, or for crowd and participation management, even for healthcare-related issues.
All data is exclusively **stored on the personal device of the user**, who can then freely decide to examine, export, and eventually intersect it with information of public utility from official sources.

Adopting **responsible behaviors and keeping track of them** is the most effective way that each individual can contribute to public health. The contribution is recognized and quantified in terms of [WOM vouchers](https://wom.social), special certificates that recognize the social value of individual actions.
